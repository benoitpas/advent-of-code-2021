my solutions for https://adventofcode.com/2021

I initially decided to use python but for the first puzzles I used a spreadsheet as it did the job quickly and efficiently ;-).

# Day 1
All spreadsheets !

# Day 2
Same !

# Day 3
Still can do part 1 with spreadsheet but part 2 is so much easier with recursion that I use python

# Day 4
Python again but trying to be more idiomatic than in day 3 and using generators.
They are quite a pain to debug as they are lazy but with no caching, i.e. can only be evaluated once. Feel a bit like a half baked lazy list implementation. I can certainly understand it is more efficient to execute but to quickly develop a working solution, it is probably better to stick to lists. And then optimize with generators if necessary.

I'm getting a better grasp of the VS code debug mode for Python which is actually great.

# Day 5
side effects galore ! tripped by .sort()

# Day 6
nice one

# Day 7
All with the spreadsheet

# Day 8
part1 with spreadsheet, part 2 with python (brute force, not really smart)
